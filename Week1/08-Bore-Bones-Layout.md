Barebones structure of WebDesign is:

1. index.html file
2. style.css in folder named css
3. script.js in folder named js

All the files should be in the same 

```bash
mkdir root_directory

cd root_directory

touch index.html

mkdir css & touch css/style.css
# mkdir css && touch css/style.css - also works

mkdir js && touch js/style.js
```
