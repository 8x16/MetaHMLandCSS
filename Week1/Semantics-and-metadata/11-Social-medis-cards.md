Before the Open Graph Protocol, search engine crawlers, including social media websites, used the internal heuristics of a website to make the best possible guess in terms of the title, description and preview images to be used for content. As expected this led to sometimes unsucessful interpretation of the post or the uinfo shared in the URL.

Even now sometimes, Images appear out-of-scale or random image that is possibly embedded somwhere in the webpage. This is where meta tags come in to help the end-user take better control of their content.

### Need for social media cards

While for other we may tailor the social media (SM) card for a specific page on a website that you're sharing, 'type' is an important OGP tag in SM cards that help describe the details of a link such as if it's a book, article, movie and so on, provided more detailed metadata for specific types. 

For example in music, we can add details for the song, album, duration or any other info about the song. For a regular user scroliing through social media, the link provided with the image preview has only one chance and a moment's attention to make good impressions. In such cases, the role of SM cards become very important.

Extra time spent by a developer to add social media tags is worth the effort
