For SEO(Search Engine Optimisation) - focuses on **content**, **semantics** and **delivery** of the content *to improve the ranking in search results*

SEO analyses HTML Document and Media Content, if it finds a link to other document it follows that page and so on. Based on the results of the analysis and the contents of the web site, Search Engine will rank the website in various search terms

### META TAGS
They define metadata about the web page
Data about the other data (web page in our case) is **metadata**. Meta tags are added inside the head element of our HTML documents and nothing inside the head element is displayed in the browser.
In other words meta tags are unseen elements, no closing tags

Meta element has two attributes, *name = name of metadata* and *content = value of the metadata*

**FEW METADATA NAMES*
author - author of the web page

description - content of the web page, displayed under search results

keywords - no longer considered, due to manipulation

robots - tells search engines, if and how to analyse the webpage, it has four values
1. index - analyse the page
2. follow - also visit all links in the web page and analyse them
3. noindex - don't analyse the page, some bots may ignore
4. nofollow - not visit links in the web page

viewport - important when designing responsive web pages, lot of values are available for this, most common is device-width and initial-scale

viewport is also important for SEO optimisation as most popular search engines also use Mobile Experience(resposiveness) in their ranking algorithms
